I am a molecular geneticist passionate about unraveling the mysteries of complex biological systems. As a self‑taught bioinformatics specialist, I can seamlessly blend the worlds of biology and computational science to analyze and interpret massive data sets. Throughout my academic journey, I have explored diverse areas—from the complexities of the brain to the intricacies of blood vessels. My passion lies in **bridging the gap between molecular biology and computational analysis.**

I’m a molecular geneticist with a deep curiosity for how life works at its most fundamental level. What excites me most is uncovering the hidden patterns in complex biological systems and turning massive amounts of data into meaningful stories about how our bodies function. Along the way, I’ve explored everything from the mysteries of the brain to the blood. I love working at the intersection of molecular biology and bioinformatics—where science meets computation—to bridge the gap between data and discovery.
